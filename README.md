It means role-playing in Irish. https://www.focloir.ie/en/dictionary/ei/role-play

## Other information

I'm just working on this for practice with C++. It's mostly off the cuff, but I
am using my D&D 3e core rulebooks. I will probably deviate, though.

## What it does
You name yourself then it displays default stats. I am only going to work on
this when I do have free time. Unfortunatly, I don't have a lot of that with
all the other projects I am working on.

## Project goal
Well, as I continue along my college education, I hope to take what I learn and
apply it here and there. I want to eventually make this go from text-only to
3d, and I will hopefully be doing this after January when I start my OpenGL
class.
